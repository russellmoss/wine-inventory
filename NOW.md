## 🎯 Current objective  (ONE thing)

Ship Plan 067 PR B — tenant-safe Linear handoff core; verify the PR preview and CI, then hold for review.

## 🧵 Tangent stack  (LIFO — push when you detour, pop when done)

1. ← you are here

## 🪝 Off-path — do NOT do now

_Anything that shows up mid-build and isn't the objective goes to `TODOS.md` or a task
chip, not into this session. Nothing parked right now._

## ✅ Done recently

- **Plan 067 PR A — agentic PLAN/FIX routing — SHIPPED, PR #181 merged** (`d2b504f`).
- **Plan 067 PR B — Linear handoff core — BUILT, PR #183 open.** Tenant-scoped/RLS-protected
  feedback-to-Linear links, sanitized handoff rules, conflict-safe link/replace actions, exact loaders,
  dual-cursor pagination, notes-version concurrency protection, and DB/isolation verification. No
  Linear API credentials are used; browser-facing workflow remains PR C.
- **Plan 066 — SO₂/KMBS ledger active-fraction fix — BUILT, eng-review PR (no auto-merge).**
  `consumeMaterialCore` gains an optional `activeFraction`; `recordNeutralDoseTx` passes it for
  ppm/mg/L SO₂ doses so the stock draw + cost = SO₂g/0.576 (KMBS), while `LotTreatment.computedTotal`
  stays delivered SO₂. Fraction from `percentActive` else 0.576. `verify:cost` flipped (31.25 g/$1.56)
  + green; cost-consume unit tests; WORKORDER-3 + invariants green; ADR 0005; read-only under-booking
  advisory. History NOT rewritten. Branch `claude/so2-kmbs-ledger-active-fraction`.
- **Plan 065 — SO₂ addition execution-view clarity — SHIPPED, PR #179 merged** (`df6c6dc`); browser-QA'd.
- **Feedback "SO2 work order unclear" — RESOLVED** (outcome note written; deeper money bug → Plan 066).
- **Plan 064 — bug-triage outcome notes — SHIPPED, PR #177 merged** (`39abefa`). Richer
  write-back (what+how / why+next) in the global workflow + SKILL.md (out-of-repo), and a
  visible outcome timeline + "Outcome" column + `resolvedAt` in `/developer`. New pure
  `parseTriageNotes` (6 tests). No schema (reuses `developerNotes`). Branch pruned; on main.
- Security #90 — cross-tenant user leak + account takeover. `src/lib/users/scope.ts` membership
  filter now scopes the `/users` page reads + all `users/actions.ts` mutators to the caller's
  effective tenant; `createUser` binds new users to the org; `resetUserPassword` gained the
  developer-target guard. Proven closed on live Bhutan/Demo data + isolation harnesses. On branch
  `claude/fix-90-cross-tenant-user-mgmt` → shipping now. Follow-up: TODOS "Per-tenant user role/state".
- Scale tripwire #166 — wrapped the 4 SERIALIZABLE work-order maintenance completion/undo
  txns in `withWriteRetry`. **SHIPPED, PR #172 merged** (`28331fd`); issue closed.
- Plan 063 developer user type (self-replicating) — **SHIPPED, PR #170 merged** (`1fda348`).
  Remaining: interactive browser QA only.

## ⏭️ Next up (candidates, not commitments)

- **Plan 062 SO₂-solution dosing — Units 2–9** (Unit 1 shipped; branch
  `claude/so2-solution-dosing`). Fixes the ~1.74× KMBS under-dose bug.
- Browser QA pass on Plan 063 (developer user type).
- **Feedback log HTML-entity garbling** — SHIPPED #178 (`6bc2db1`).
- **Plan 065 — SO₂ addition execution-view clarity — BUILT, shipping.** Execute view is now
  summary-first + edit-gated ("Add 14 ppm SO₂ to Tank 4 → ≈ X L of 10% KMBS solution"); landed
  `resolveSo2Dose` (×0.576) on main; captured solutionPercentKmbs through NL/assistant authoring;
  new pure `buildTaskSummary`. Green locally: tsc, eslint, `next build`, vitest 1927. No schema.
  Branch `claude/addition-execution-view-clarity`. Remaining: CI + browser QA on `/work-orders/*/execute`.
