## 🎯 Current objective  (ONE thing)

**Plan 068 — user inbox / Gmail-like messaging — BACKEND COMPLETE, UI remaining** on branch
`claude/user-inbox-messaging` (off origin/main). DONE + committed + all green with live DB exit-proofs:
Unit 1 (schema+RLS migrations), 1b (per-user RLS `app.user_id` GUC — core extension), 2 (notification
core), 3 (DM core + shared blob + authed attachment route), 4 (governed ticket hooks), 5 (governed WO
hooks), 9 (INBOX-1 invariant + verify:inbox-isolation 11/11 + CRLF checker fix + channel seam + ADR 0006).
**REMAINING — need the USER's browser login for QA:** Unit 6 (avatar red unread badge, gate behind flag),
7 (/inbox Gmail three-pane + buckets + tombstones), 8 (DM compose UI). Then `npx next build` + browser QA
in Demo Winery. Do NOT auto-merge — PR + eng review (governed money-adjacent core).
GOTCHA locked: emit MUST use `createMany` not `create` (create's RETURNING trips the per-user SELECT policy).
NOTE: I stopped the local `npm run dev` server (Prisma DLL lock during generate) — restart it for UI QA.

## 🪝 Off-path — do NOT do now

- **Plan 062 Units 2/5 — liquid-solution booking (feature gap, NOT the money bug).** Booking a
  *stocked liquid KMBS-solution material* by ppm currently books an UNKNOWN-cost line with no depletion
  (no durable `so2SolutionPercentKmbs` field; `consumeMaterialCore` can't convert g→mL). Powder KMBS is
  fully correct. Needs a governed schema change + eng review — separate plan when prioritized, not now.

## ✅ Done recently

- **SO₂ ~1.74× dosing money bug — RECONCILED CLOSED (2026-07-15, no code change).** Investigated on a
  fresh branch off `origin/main`: the money-critical fix already shipped. Plan 066 (PR #180, `370b7b6`,
  MERGED) divides the stock draw by the active fraction in `consumeMaterialCore` (÷0.576); Plan 065
  (PR #179) landed `resolveSo2Dose` — used **display-only**, so no double-application. `verify:cost`
  55/55 green (40 ppm × 450 L → 18 g SO₂ delivered, 31.25 g KMBS drawn, $1.56). Running `/work` on
  Plan 062 would have DOUBLE-APPLIED 0.576 and re-broken `verify:cost` — deliberately did not.
  Remaining Plan 062 scope (liquid-solution booking) is a feature gap → Off-path.

- **Plan 068 — user inbox / Gmail-like messaging — PLANNED + eng + council + CEO reviewed; QUEUED.**
  CEO review: HOLD scope (full 10 units, DMs kept) but sequenced BEHIND the SO₂ money-bug line. Ready for
  `/work docs/plans/2026-07-15-068-...` once 062/066 clear. Consider `/plan-design-review` before Unit 7.
  Avatar-anchored inbox (red unread badge) with All / Work Orders / Tickets / Direct-messages buckets;
  discrete `InboxNotification` rows drive unread, WO/Tickets buckets are live "mine-only" views, same-tenant
  1:1 DMs with attachments. Eng review verified the tx piggyback is atomic + the WO rollup double-emit
  guard; council (Codex+Gemini) added 10 consensus fixes (private-blob auth, rollup-returns-change-object,
  idempotent-emit-on-write, DM org-membership validation, click-through tombstones, +5). User resolved 3
  tensions → per-user RLS (`app.user_id` GUC, Unit 1b), keep email snapshots, lightweight DM rate-cap.
  Plan file `docs/plans/2026-07-15-068-...`. Not yet built.
- **Feedback cmrm5x3lq "vineyard identification" — SHIPPED, PR #190 merged; ticket RESOLVED.**
  Assistant told admin Mike "the Bajo vineyard doesn't exist" — `resolveVineyards`
  (`src/lib/assistant/scope.ts`) used a one-directional SQL `contains`, so the stored name
  "Bajo" failed to match "Bajo Vineyard". Added pure `vineyardNameMatches` (two-directional,
  mirrors `findScopedBlocks`), match in JS after untouched access scoping. Proven on live data
  (scope preserved for non-admins) + tenant-isolation CI green; 7-case regression test;
  assistant suite 25f/145t green. Reviewed (1 LOW note: 200-vineyard fetch cap, non-issue at
  realistic counts). Also shipped the calculator display fix (PR #189, browser-QA'd).
- **bug-triage `/bug-triage` dry-run RAN LIVE this session — REMEDIATED.** `args` reached the workflow
  as a JSON *string*, so `args.dryRun` was `undefined` → `DRY_RUN=false`. It dispatched a real
  `feedback_bug_fix` run (calculator display) + `feedback_plan` run (harvest-pick deletion), dismissed
  the thumbs-down ticket, set 5 statuses. Nothing merged to `main`. All triage decisions were sound, so
  kept (not rolled back). The calculator fix run completed → **PR #189 "fix: display" open for review**
  (nothing to cancel). Vineyard ticket cmrm5x3lq updated to IN_PROGRESS/DEFECT + PR #190 note.
  Hazard memory hardened ([[bug-triage-dryrun-args-gotcha]]) — burned twice now.
- **Plan 067 PR A — agentic PLAN/FIX routing — SHIPPED, PR #181 merged** (`d2b504f`).
- **Plan 067 PR B — Linear handoff core — BUILT, PR #183 open.** Tenant-scoped/RLS-protected
  feedback-to-Linear links, sanitized handoff rules, conflict-safe link/replace actions, exact loaders,
  dual-cursor pagination, notes-version concurrency protection, and DB/isolation verification. No
  Linear API credentials are used; browser-facing workflow remains PR C.
- **Plan 066 — SO₂/KMBS ledger active-fraction fix — BUILT, eng-review PR (no auto-merge).**
  `consumeMaterialCore` gains an optional `activeFraction`; `recordNeutralDoseTx` passes it for
  ppm/mg/L SO₂ doses so the stock draw + cost = SO₂g/0.576 (KMBS), while `LotTreatment.computedTotal`
  stays delivered SO₂. Fraction from `percentActive` else 0.576. `verify:cost` flipped (31.25 g/$1.56)
  + green; cost-consume unit tests; WORKORDER-3 + invariants green; ADR 0005; read-only under-booking
  advisory. History NOT rewritten. Branch `claude/so2-kmbs-ledger-active-fraction`.
- **Plan 065 — SO₂ addition execution-view clarity — SHIPPED, PR #179 merged** (`df6c6dc`); browser-QA'd.
- **Feedback "SO2 work order unclear" — RESOLVED** (outcome note written; deeper money bug → Plan 066).
- **Plan 064 — bug-triage outcome notes — SHIPPED, PR #177 merged** (`39abefa`). Richer
  write-back (what+how / why+next) in the global workflow + SKILL.md (out-of-repo), and a
  visible outcome timeline + "Outcome" column + `resolvedAt` in `/developer`. New pure
  `parseTriageNotes` (6 tests). No schema (reuses `developerNotes`). Branch pruned; on main.
- Security #90 — cross-tenant user leak + account takeover. `src/lib/users/scope.ts` membership
  filter now scopes the `/users` page reads + all `users/actions.ts` mutators to the caller's
  effective tenant; `createUser` binds new users to the org; `resetUserPassword` gained the
  developer-target guard. Proven closed on live Bhutan/Demo data + isolation harnesses. On branch
  `claude/fix-90-cross-tenant-user-mgmt` → shipping now. Follow-up: TODOS "Per-tenant user role/state".
- Scale tripwire #166 — wrapped the 4 SERIALIZABLE work-order maintenance completion/undo
  txns in `withWriteRetry`. **SHIPPED, PR #172 merged** (`28331fd`); issue closed.
- Plan 063 developer user type (self-replicating) — **SHIPPED, PR #170 merged** (`1fda348`).
  Remaining: interactive browser QA only.

## ⏭️ Next up (candidates, not commitments)

- Browser QA pass on Plan 063 (developer user type).
- **Feedback log HTML-entity garbling** — SHIPPED #178 (`6bc2db1`).
- **Plan 065 — SO₂ addition execution-view clarity — BUILT, shipping.** Execute view is now
  summary-first + edit-gated ("Add 14 ppm SO₂ to Tank 4 → ≈ X L of 10% KMBS solution"); landed
  `resolveSo2Dose` (×0.576) on main; captured solutionPercentKmbs through NL/assistant authoring;
  new pure `buildTaskSummary`. Green locally: tsc, eslint, `next build`, vitest 1927. No schema.
  Branch `claude/addition-execution-view-clarity`. Remaining: CI + browser QA on `/work-orders/*/execute`.
